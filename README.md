🚗 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard - Excel Project 📊

I recently completed an Excel-based Road Accident Analysis Dashboard, providing key insights into accident trends and their impact. This interactive dashboard helps identify patterns and risk factors, aiding in data-driven decision-making for road safety improvements.

🔹 Key Insights:
✅ Total Casualties: 121,251, categorized into fatal, serious, and slight injuries
✅ Casualties by Vehicle Type: Highest for motorcycles, followed by cars and buses
✅ Trends Over Time: Comparison of 2021 vs. 2022 casualties, showing monthly fluctuations
✅ Casualties by Road Type: Highest on single carriageways, with significant numbers on dual carriageways and roundabouts
✅ Impact of Road Surface & Light Conditions: Majority of accidents occur on dry roads, with daylight conditions being the most common

📌 Dashboard Features:
🔹 Interactive filters for accident year and urban/rural areas
🔹 Data visualizations including trend lines, pie charts, and bar graphs
🔹 Insights into accident-prone conditions to enhance road safety measures

This project strengthened my data visualization, analytical skills, and dashboard design using Excel. Let me know your thoughts or suggestions! 🚦
